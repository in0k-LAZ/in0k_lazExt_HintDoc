/* Pointers to the currently active dialog and menu objects.
 *
 * Note: active_dialog_player always points to the currently active dialog
 * player. However, active_menu_player only ever points to menu players
 * started by a d_menu_proc. The code also assumes that that d_menu_proc can
 * be found in the currently active dialog.
 *
 * Note: active_dialog points to the whole dialog currently running. However,
 * active_menu points to the *current item* of the currently running menu,
 * and should really have been called active_menu_item.
